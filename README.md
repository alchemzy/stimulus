I chose the amazon review trained model: https://huggingface.co/LiYuan/amazon-review-sentiment-analysis
- it is trained on product reviews and customer sentiment on products.
- to get the star ratings for a simple easy to understand 5 point rating.
Caveats: If more is known about the type of product reviews being made, a more optimal model can be chosen that better fits the requirements.


The data was compiled into json in "data.json", composed of review, star rating, and score.
